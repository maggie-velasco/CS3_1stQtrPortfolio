> 1. __Interesting key points:__
* internship and pre-employment program for incoming college students
* development of more water districts
* improvement of MRT and LRT
* implementation of free internet

> 2. __Weird key points:__
* 20 pesos rice
* 0 balance billing
* presidential merit scholarship for high honored students

> 3. __Reflection__  

During our president's State of the Nation's Address, I've learned a lot of projects and promises that have been implemented or are planned for our country. Examples of them are **free wifi and mobile load** in some areas, as well as the **presidential merit scholarship**. Since the internet is needed nowadays, especially for education, the free wifi and load would be really useful especially for students in rural areas. Moreover, the presidential merit scholarship, which would be given to high-achieving students, could motivate more learners to study and aim better.

While these projects amazed me, there are some that I think are not accessible for all of the Filipinos. Some of them include providing **salaries** for every citizen, **the 20 pesos rice**, and the **0 balance billings** in hospitals. These projects are reassuring, but our budget and resources are not enough to provide them to all of the citizens. So, I hope the government would find a way to improve our country and to help all of the Filipinos.
