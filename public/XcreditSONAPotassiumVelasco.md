> 1. Interesting key points:

* improvement of MRT and LRT
* renewable energy

> 2. Weird key points:
* 20 pesos rice
* implementation of free internet
* presidential merit scholarship for high honored students

> 3. Reflection
During our president's State of the Nation's Address, I've learned a lot of projects and promises that have been implemented or are planned for our country. Examples of them are free wifi and mobile load in some areas, as well as the presidential merit scholarship. Since the internet is needed nowadays, especially for education, the free wifi and load would be really useful especially for students in rural areas. Moreover, the presidential merit scholarship, which would be given to high-achieving students, could motivate more learners to study and aim better.

While these projects amazed me, there are some that I think are not accessible for all of the Filipinos. Some of them include providing salaries for every citizen, the 20 pesos rice, and the 0 balance billings in hospitals. These projects are reassuring, but our budget and resources are not enough to provide them to all of the citizens. So, I hope the government would find a way to improve our country and to help all of the Filipinos.


> 4. For the Philippines!!

STAY UNITED!!!! :D
