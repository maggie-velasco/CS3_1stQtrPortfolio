# REFLECTIONS!!

> List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
- [x] **Conditional statements** are also known as “if-else statements”.  This establishes the “cause-and-effect” situation where a condition is present in a given code. Then, a specific action is made if that condition returns true. If it’s false, the program either skips that part or does something else if an else exists. 
- [x] **While loops**, on the other hand, are a bit different. They execute a certain block of code over and over again as long as the condition returns false. For example, the condition is “while a number is less than or equal to 5”. A specific action will be made until the number is soon greater than 5. 
- [x] **Do-while loops** can sometimes be mistaken and interchanged with while loops. Instead, it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. After,  it determines when the condition returns true or false. Like the example above, the loop will perform the action first before comparing if the number is less than or equal to 5.
- [x] **For loops**, unlike while and do-while loops, can determine the number of times an action is done. It is divided into three parts: initialization, condition, and update statements. The first one
- [x] **Operators** can be classified into arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. Artihmetic operatos are used when variabes are added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided, and needs a remainder. Examples are the +,-,*,/, or % signs. Comparison operators, like the name, are being used in comparing, like ==, <, >, <=, >=, or !=. Logical operators, on the other hand, returns an output if the statements are true or false. The "and" symbol is expressed as &&, while the "or" symbol is ||. The last operators are used when you want to assign values in a specific variable. This sign used is the "=" sign. 

> List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
- *Arrays* : I was able to understand how arrays, work, but I still need help in using them in codes.
- *Functions* :
- *

> Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.



> In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
