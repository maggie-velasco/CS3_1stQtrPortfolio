Comparison operators, like the name, are being used in comparing, like ==, <, >, <=, >=, or !=. Logical operators, on the other hand return if the statements are true or false. The "and" symbol is expressed as &&, while the "or" symbol is ||. The last operators are used when you want to assign values in a specific variable. This sign used is the "=" sign.
